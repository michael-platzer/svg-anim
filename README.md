# Create animations with SVGs

This repository provides a build script to create animated slides from Inkscape SVG files.
Draw an SVG in Inkscape and place the content into multiple layers.
Specify the animation steps during which a layer shall appear in the layer's name.
The syntax is similar to [the LaTeX beamer package's](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) `\only` command.
